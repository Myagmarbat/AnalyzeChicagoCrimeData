This project Performed Chicago Crime Data Analysis with Apache Spark and Scala. Identified factors correlated to high crime rate.

To run the code:
1- put the the crimes.csv file on file:////home/cloudera/workspace/sparkexample/crimes.csv.
2- import the project into Eclipse IDE with scala
3- excute the each scala file
4- The output files will be generated under the directory of sparkexample.

Or comment each file with following:
/*object testingsort extends App{
  override def  main(args: Array[String]) {
    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Spark Sort").setMaster("local")
    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)*/
Then execute file in scala command line with -i filename.


About the source of data:

The original data can be got from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present-398a4 .
Have done some little transform work to make it easy to analysis data.
In real analysis project, we extract about 39000 lines data occured in June,2007.
Please check out the data crimes.csv.  


The analysis code in under location sparkexample\src\main\scala.
